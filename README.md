# Chat App using Flutter, Supabase, Bloc

This is a chat application built using Flutter for the frontend, Supabase for the backend, Bloc for state management, and Clean Architecture for project structure. Dependency Injection is used to manage dependencies efficiently.

## Features

- User authentication with Supabase
- Real-time messaging
- Bloc pattern for state management
- Clean Architecture for maintainability and scalability
- Dependency Injection for managing dependencies

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Supabase: An open-source Firebase alternative. It provides a set of tools and libraries to build scalable web and mobile applications.
- Bloc: A predictable state management library that helps implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern.
- Clean Architecture: A software design philosophy that separates concerns into layers, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
- Dependency Injection: A technique for managing dependencies between objects, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/noshad76/supabase-chat-app.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd supabase-chat-app`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Usage

1. Upon launching the app, you will be prompted to sign in or sign up using Supabase authentication.
2. Once logged in, you can start sending and receiving messages in real-time.
3. Bloc pattern is employed for managing application state.
4. Clean Architecture helps maintain the project structure and separates concerns.
5. Dependency Injection ensures efficient management of dependencies.
